Abstract
Purpose
Accurate detection and treatment of Coronary Artery Disease is mainly based on invasive Coronary Angiography, which could be avoided provided that a robust, non-invasive detection methodology emerged. Despite the progress of computational systems, this remains a challenging issue. The present research investigates Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods in competing with the medical experts' diagnostic yield. Although the highly accurate detection of Coronary Artery Disease, even from the experts, is presently implausible, developing Artificial Intelligence models to compete with the human eye and expertise is the first step towards a state-of-the-art Computer-Aided Diagnostic system.

Methods
A set of 566 patient samples is analysed. The dataset contains Polar Maps derived from scintigraphic Myocardial Perfusion Imaging studies, clinical data, and Coronary Angiography results. The latter is considered as reference standard. For the classification of the medical images, the InceptionV3 Convolutional Neural Network is employed, while, for the categorical and continuous features, Neural Networks and Random Forest classifier are proposed.

Results
The research suggests that an optimal strategy competing with the medical expert's accuracy involves a hybrid multi-input network composed of InceptionV3 and a Random Forest. This method matches the expert's accuracy, which is 79.15% in the particular dataset.

Conclusion
Image classification using deep learning methods can cooperate with clinical data classification methods to enhance the robustness of the predicting model, aiming to compete with the medical expert's ability to identify Coronary Artery Disease subjects, from a large scale patient dataset.
